Credits
-------
  * Plugin is based off [LiveSplit.HitmanAbsolution](https://github.com/SuiMachine/LiveSplit.HitmanAbsolution) by [SuicideMachine](http://twitch.tv/suicidemachine).
  * Stats struct and a bunch of offsets ripped off from [Orfeaz's Statman](https://github.com/OrfeasZ/Statman)
  * Fucking sue me if you want to, I honestly don't give a shit. I have dealt with github for 20 minutes now, trying to do the entire gay little dance with "crediting people" and "readmes", and that is about the limit for me.
